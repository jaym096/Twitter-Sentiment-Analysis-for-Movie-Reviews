38 What a gut wrenching performance @aliaa08! #raazi
39 Let's just pause for a moment and digest the fact that people are rushing to watch a movie run by an actress. Not a khan, kapoor, or kumar. #raazi
40 @DanceEatRepeat @nonsanskaari Iqbal is Vicky’s character name in #Raazi
41 @meghnagulzar @aliaa08 @vickykaushal09 @vineetjaintimes @karanjohar @apoorvamehta18 @JungleePictures @DharmaMovies @RaaziHoon Pakistan banned Raazi.  I watched on Utube. The movie reminds us  of the 1971 war we lost and our eastern arm with it.India’s Glory.Not ours

Juggles multiple genres effortlessly, be it drama, thriller, espionage or just a plain love story. @aliaa08 is luminous. The outstanding supporting cast is no less effective.

56 Just watched #RAAZI  !!! And @aliaa08 proved it again she is a best youngest actor right now bollywood has.. And the very remarkable direction of @meghnagulzar no one said that Raazi is her 1st film to direct! You have to go long way..

59 @i_surbhichawla Raazi is too beautiful.
60 @Box_Off_India Don't do this idiocity of tagging celebrities for gaining followers. Stop supporting specific actors and producers movies. We can easily make it out now... Recenet eg. #October #Raazi

67 I'm listening to "Ae Watan - Raazi" by Arijit Singh.
68 How well put. I had a similar thought while listening to the song ae watan from Raazi. How ww would think our roots are connected to the nation and we carry it in our hearts with pride. https://t.co/XsOe6IiLJK
69 My piece was on the western front- @RaaziHoon was on the eastern front.  #TheGhaziAttack begins where #Raazi ends. Go watch. Brilliant Both.  @aliaa08 will have difficulty walking with the multiple awards in the offing. @karanjohar -one man behind both. @meghnagulzar -Take a bow. https://t.co/hsFKvxpvUu

75 Last Sunday I went to watch #Raazi at @INOXMovies  satyam nehru place. No doubts that they did consider accessibility in the initial design and has ramps/elevators but there's one issue I had to sit just in front of the screen while I booked for the premium rows
76 Okay Raazi is superrrrrr stressful. I guess that makes it good. 🙄
77 Let me cry first 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  Raazi is AWESOME , this is all i can say @aliaa08 @vickykaushal09

81 @BollyNumbers @varunSrkian @taran_adarsh Got that. I felt that 102* &amp; Raazi were sold outrightly too. Anyways , happy that both films are doing well.
82 @BrijwaSRKman @varunSrkian @taran_adarsh No brother,  In case of Tubelight &amp; JHMS, producer outright sold film to Distributor at Huge price &amp; Distributor losses money.   In case of  #Raazi - Distributor take his commision &amp; rest money transferred to Producer.  #Hitcki &amp; #102NotOut - Distributed by producer itself.
83 #Raazi will remain hard to beat for a long time #mohitahlawat will remain a surprise package for all #vickykaushal remained good in parts though! But it’s an #AliaBhatt gem all the way
84 In the current times of hyper-nationalism (in India at least) where so many ads and movies use the Army as an instrument to over-glorify the nation, @meghnagulzar's balanced and realistic take without any unnecessary jingoism is a big breath of fresh air #Raazi

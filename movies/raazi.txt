82 @BrijwaSRKman @varunSrkian @taran_adarsh No brother,  In case of Tubelight &amp; JHMS, producer outright sold film to Distributor at Huge price &amp; Distributor losses money.   In case of  #Raazi - Distributor take his commision &amp; rest money transferred to Producer.  #Hitcki &amp; #102NotOut - Distributed by producer itself.
83 #Raazi will remain hard to beat for a long time #mohitahlawat will remain a surprise package for all #vickykaushal remained good in parts though! But it‚Äôs an #AliaBhatt gem all the way
84 In the current times of hyper-nationalism (in India at least) where so many ads and movies use the Army as an instrument to over-glorify the nation, @meghnagulzar's balanced and realistic take without any unnecessary jingoism is a big breath of fresh air #Raazi

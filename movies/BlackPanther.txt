8 The beat playing behind the scene in Shuri's lab in #BlackPanther, is a genre of House music called Gqom (the q is a clicking sound) originating from South Africa. Here's the track: https://t.co/LYO8H4tFzn
9 the whole voice over the okoye and wakabi scene about growing hair is not funny. it is not banter. it is degrading. it really shud be shunned. it angers and grieves my soul. dats some demonic influenced video  #teamokoye #blackpanther

28 @SweetStocks22 @keithcalder Bill, you better skip #BlackPanther whose cast is half female.  Then there's #doramilaje  a literal army of women backing up the Panther.
29 Is it me, or you also feel like crying when you remember how #blackpanther movie was so AWESOME! https://t.co/7pinVp2tyj
30 #Mampintsha is on every #BabesWodumo track. That to me means he can't let her shine on her own, he has an obsession, he always wants her next to him he even made it to the #BlackPanther track when SA thought it would be just Babes. I am not surprised by abuse allegations. https://t.co/RYmqIveOLD
31 My bachelor weekend has begun! Now watching #BlackPanther!
32 This. This fucking aesthetic. I love it so much. #BlackPanther https://t.co/ZVRHTvHNE1
33 #BlackPanther is a helluva movie! Don‚Äôt even get to catch your breath until halfway through. @letitiawright was adorable and sexy as hell too.
34 I think this marketing rivals Deadpool's. #CivilWaris the first movie event to shake the MCU. #Avengers #CaptainAmerica #IronMan #BlackPanther #Falcon #ScarletWitch #WinterSoldier https://t.co/N0jNOh9Tni

71 Because of the @JoeyBossa controversy, I have to comment. I haven't seen the last three @Marvel movies #BlackPanther , #ThorRagnarok and #InfinityWar because the previews look #stupid . #Marvel getting dumber.
